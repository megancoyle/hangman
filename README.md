# Hangman JavaScript Game

## Approach
I decided to use the canvas element to create drawings that would render for each part of the hangman.

## User Stories
* As a user, I should know when I guess incorrectly by seeing a counter for number of guesses remaining.
* As a user, I should be able to know when I guess correctly by seeing letters appear for my guess.
* As a user, I should be able to press a button/link to select my letter choice.
* As a user, I should know when the game is over by receiving a 'game over' message.
* As a user, I be able to play again.
